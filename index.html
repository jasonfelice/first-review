      <h2>Here's a time line of Alan Turing's life:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1912: <span>Alan Mathison Turing was born in London</span></li>
        <li>1926: <span>Aged 14, he was sent to Sherborne School in Dorset. His first day of term coincided with the 1926 General Strike. Turing was so determined not to miss his first day of school that he cycled the 97km from his home in Southampton.</span></li>
        <li>1927: <span>At the age of 16, Turing got to grips with Albert Einstein's work and extrapolated Einstein's questioning of Newton's Laws of Motion from a text in which this was never made explicit.</span></li>
        <li>1930: <span>Turing's close school friend Christopher Morcom dies suddenly from bovine tuberculosis. Turing renounces his religious faith and becomes an atheist.</span></li>
        <li>1931: <span>Turing goes to study Mathematics at King's College, Cambridge.</span></li>
        <li>1935: <span>Turing proves the central limit theorem in his dissertation and is made a fellow at King's at the age of just 22.</span></li>
        <li>1936: <span>Turing published his paper On Computable Numbers and an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) in which he outlines the Universal Machine, which later became known as the Turing Machine.</span> </li>
        <li>936-1938: <span>Turing spent time at Princeton in the US studying under Alonzo Church. There he started to study cryptology as well as mathematics.</span></li>
        <li>1938: <span>Turing started to work part-time at the Government Code and Cypher School.</span></li>
        <li>1939: <span>The day after war is declared in September 1939, Turing arrives at Bletchley Park. There he works with Gordon Welchman to develop the Bombe, a device for decrypting the messages sent by Germans using their Enigma machines. The Bombe built on a machine that the Polish had already made, called the Bomba Kryptlogiczna. Turing used statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code-breaking process using probability.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="quote">"I believe that at the end of the century the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted"</p>
